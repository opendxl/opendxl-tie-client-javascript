## Overview

The
[McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange](http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/threat-intelligence-exchange.aspx) 
(TIE) DXL JavaScript client library provides a high level wrapper for the TIE
[Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx)
(DXL) API.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to access the features of TIE
(manage reputations, determine where a file has executed, etc.) without having
to focus on lower-level details such as TIE-specific DXL topics and message
formats.
